						<p>Since June, successive waves of protests against a controversial
							extradition bill have occurred every weekend in Hong Kong. Over time, the conflict
							associated with the demonstrations has intensified, involving journalists to implicate
							certain disturbances.</p>

						<p>Being blamed as “搏出位” (drawing attention) and a “妓者” (a word
							combining prostitute and
							journalist), Amy Ip, a freelance female journalist, said in an interview with Stand News
							that her name and photo are also spread in online groups of pro-establishment camp.
							These
							all happened after she read out a statement in a press conference criticizing the police
							force treated media workers violently.</p>

						<p>On 28 October, Amy protested at the police press conference by reading out the statement
							and
							pointing a flashlight at the police officials to demonstrate how police treated
							journalists
							during the protest.</p>

						<p>Verbal attacks targeting the gender of journalists specifically happen on females,
							including
							wordings about journalists’ appearance and sex. Wordings like “妓者” (a word combining
							prostitute and journalist), “臭雞” (smelly chicken, while the chicken is often used to
							describe prostitute) and “八婆” (gossip old lady, means similar to bitch) is commonly used
							to
							describe females rudely, including female journalists.</p>

						<p>In the recent ongoing protests across the city, journalists face attacks, including
							verbal
							and physical, during their reporting work. Journalists of different genders may face
							different levels of threats. Jessica Lo, a part-time year-4 journalist in nowTV, said
							that
							female journalists face more personal attacks because of gender and appearance.</p>

				<p>Q: Can you briefly describe the situation of that day?</p>
				<p>J: I arrived outside of RTHK alone at around 2 pm. My cameraman was still on the way from the office,
					so
					I decided to use my mobile phone to take some footage. Before taking the videos, I wore a yellow
					vest
					and put on press card to avoid any misunderstanding from the crowds. However, some participants
					surrounded me and stopped me from videotaping.</p>

				<p>Q: Have you encountered any problems during the protest, such as physically and verbally?</p>
				<p>J: I was kicked two times by a stranger and a woman during walking beside RTHK. When I was filming
					while
					taking videos, someone hit my camera and nearly fell to the ground. For verbally, some participants
					pointed at me and almost touched my eyes. As most of the participants are male and most of the
					journalists are female, nearly all female journalists are blamed and encircled. They said some words
					that were targeting at the female.</p>

				<p>Q: Do you think it is sexual harassment?</p>
				<p>J: Yes, I will regard this as sexual harassment. They said tones of sexual words. Though I did
					not face any sexual harassment physically before, I know some girls have experienced that.</p>

				<p>Q: What do you feel when you hear those words?</p>
				<p>J: I admit I feel scared, but I know it was useless to argue with them. I do feel frustrated because
					of
					his action at that moment, but I can hardly hear what he said. When I go back home and watch the
					playback, I can clearly understand what he said. (Taking a deep breath)I must commit that I have
					hard
					feelings after watching those videos. It is hard to stay calm with all the insult.</p>

				<p>Q: How can you cope with hard feelings? Did you cry?</p>
				<p>J: No, I did not cry. But I feel upset. I just think that doing an interview is my job and I want to
					report the truth. Why do they need to treat me like that? Maybe I’m still fresh. I know some
					journalists
					might get used to it, but I really cannot stand and remain silent.</p>

				<p>Q: Do you think male journalists faceless sexual abuse than female journalists?</p>
				<p>J: Yes. I think male journalists will face less sexual insult as those words do not work for them.
					They
					are usually attacked because of their professions. I believe that female journalists face more
					personal
					attacks because of gender and appearance.</p>

				<p>Q: Did you report to NowTV immediately? What did they do to help you?</p>
				<p>J: Yes, NowTV sent another crew to help us later. Moreover, NowTV reported to the police at once, but
					you know it doesn’t help much at all. I expect no people will be arrested in this event.</p>

				<p>Q: Do you think that the whole of society has gender discrimination for the journalist industry?</p>
				<p>J: Kind of. The image of male journalists is smart and familiar with numbers. Thus, they are usually
					responsible for financial news. However, there are also advantages of female journalists. For
					example,
					we are always regarded as caring and talkative. Investigative reporting and feature stories are
					usually
					packed by us.</p>

				<p>Q: What do you think your agency can help? Is there any pre- or pro-protest assistance for the
					journalists?</p>
				<p>J: I think the media agency can provide mental support for full-time journalists on how to get rid of
					unhappiness. They provide training to all journalists for preparation, but it is mainly focused on
					practical skills.</p>

			<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 subtext to-animate">

				<p>Q：After this period, can you recall one most memorable interview experience?</p>
				<p>V: That must be June 30, one Sunday. I participated in the reporting both the
					Pro-Democratic Parade near Legislative Council and pro-police rally in the Tamar Park
					not far away. The interviews on two sides left me with a deep impression, especially in
					the pro-police rally.</p>

				<p>Most of the supporters are middle-aged, who are very sensitive to my identity as a
					journalist. They will charge us for news reporting that the story is biased and
					challenging the professionalism of journalists, particularly young female journalists.
					They blame us for being the mouthpiece of the mob and beautifying the behavior of the
					demonstrators opposed to police, and this is not the case.</p>

				<p>Q: In addition to questioning the professionalism of journalists, is there any
					discrimination against the gender of journalists?</p>

				<p>V: I didn't encounter some insults targeting women at that time (June 30) explicitly.
					However, in the later interview of "Reclaim Sheung Shui," we were subjected to some
					unwarranted scolding and shirking from the police. Still remember some other female
					journalists have indicated that the police have physically contacted them, warning the
					behavior of the police on the spot is sexual harassment.</p>

				<p>In fact, female reporters will be more easily despised and ordered, and the police will
					be able to ask female reporters to avoid some reporting. Simultaneously, my male
					colleague will not be as much attention as the police. The fun thing is that I often
					receive water from the police and the gas mask handed to me by the demonstrators during
					the protest. It may be that girls need to gain more attention on the front-line in most
					ordinary people's minds.</p>

				<p>Q: As you said, your male colleague will not be as much attention as the police, can you
					elaborate it specifically?</p>

				<p>V: Well, as an intern reporter, I don't really have much experience in on-site
					reporting. During a demonstration near Hong Kong Liaison Office, the police have raised
					their warning flag to indicate that they will release tear gas. I didn't realize to
					forget to bring equipment such as gas masks until then so that I turned to the police
					for help. Nevertheless, they just want to drive me away and leave the scene to run in a
					safe place. Their attitude is like saying that a little girl does not need to appear on
					the stage.</p>

				<p>Similar mistrust can also happen in my news agency. As far as my editor is concerned,
					she will have more consideration for female reporters. In her cognition, men usually
					gain more strength in communication with police or demonstrators. When assigning
					interviews, she will definitely send a full-time male reporter, and there will be some
					special precautions before the interview.</p>

				<p>It's hard to judge whether it's sex discrimination, but it is always considered that it
					is impossible to allow me to be on the front line full of gunpowder.</p>

				<p>Q: How does this nearly three-month experience affect your mood?</p>

				<p>V: No doubt, there will be some trauma and cracks in my inner center. For example, every
					time I see hundreds of heavy-duty explosion-proof police officers knocking on the shield
					loudly, shouting "go away" with a significant decibel continuously, as if to knock us
					back. But as a journalist, I should stick to the front line.</p>

				<p>The mental shadow of the verbal attack is also somber. If you participate in the
					pro-police rally, you will not wear clad in black, try to wear light-colored clothes,
					even no mask.</p>

				<p>Q: Are these traumata repairable? Do you think your news agency needs to provide
					corresponding help?</p>

				<p>V: Whether in the past few months, Hong Kong's political atmosphere or its own working
					environment is very repressed. There's always distrust between the two parties(police
					and demonstrators). If there is a slightly biased content reported by the journalists,
					the buzz of the other party will appear.</p>

				<p>I think the best way is solving by yourself. It is also allowed if you want to seek some
					counseling from the news agency. At the same time, my editor-in-chief also talks to me
					from time to time and cares about my physical and mental health. If you feel
					uncomfortable, you are also very free to allow leave.</p>

				<p>“We become more sensitive after covering the protests in this period, especially when we smell the
					smell of tear gas or hear a sudden loud voice in normal days,” said Bethanie Ho, a journalist,
					working in Ming Pao, who graduated from Hong Kong Baptist University 3 years ago.</p>

				<p>Covering the protests put different mental pressure on journalists. And they suffer from mixed
					emotions after covering the protests.
				</p>
				<p>On 12th June, it is the start of the movement’s forced upgrade. “After that day, we need to go back
					to finish our news story with a calm and professional attitude under the chaotic situation. I feel
					difficult to pull myself away from the emotion that night after I finished my story.”
				</p>

				<p>“Journalists on the frontline understand they may be hurt anytime which is also a kind of pressure we
					are suffering,” Ho added. “For myself, I feel the worst on 17th June. I saw the changes in the
					movement and felt powerless.” On 17th June, a man committed suicide with his political appeal by
					jumping down from Pacific Place in Admiralty.
				</p>

				<p>In the survey, 89.09% of the reporters agree that news agencies should provide journalists with
					emotional and psychological counseling.

				<p>When asked whether journalists need psychological counseling, Ho and her colleague Alpha Chan show
					their support for it.
				</p>

				<p>“Journalists’ mental health is something that should be focused on. Especially when journalists
					always witness things that normal people don’t experience,” said Alpha Chan, also a journalist
					working in Ming Pao. She mentioned that journalists might not feel well after reporting on different
					accidents, especially severe accidents like Amoycan Industrial Centre fire in 2016, double-decker
					bus flipped accident in Tai Po in 2018, and also the protest ongoing now.
				</p>

				<p>Their news agency arranged talks and sharing, like inviting psychological professors to support
					journalists psychologically. These kinds of support are not provided to every journalist. Jessica Lo
					suggested that the agency can give mental assistance to all journalists, especially full-time and
					front-line staff.
				</p>

				<p>“If there is mental assistance provided, I would leave the chance to other journalists as I didn’t
					suffer from serious trauma after reporting on the protests. I think the more front-line journalists
					may need it more,” said Anna Kam, a year 4 student majoring in International Journalism at Hong Kong
					Baptist University. She worked as a freelance journalist for four international media agencies.

				<p>Similar mistrust can also happen in my news agency. As far as my editor is concerned,
					she will have more consideration for female reporters. In her cognition, men usually
					gain more strength in communication with police or demonstrators. When assigning
					interviews, she will definitely send a full-time male reporter, and there will be some
					special precautions before the interview.</p>

				<p>It's hard to judge whether it's sex discrimination, but it is always considered that it

					<p>When reporters encounter some physical abuse during reporting, such as sexual harassment, perhaps
						there are already relevant laws that can protect them.
					</p>

					<p>As one of the discrimination law ordinances in Hong Kong, Sex Discrimination Ordinance (SDO)
						protects a person from sexual harassment and victimization in prescribed areas of activities,
						including employment.
					</p>

					<p>“Journalists and practitioners in the media industry have the same protection from sexual
						harassment and sex discrimination under the SDO.,” claimed Dorothy Sam, Corporate Communications
						Manager of Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) in a written reply.
					</p>

					<p>Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) handles complaints from people who feel that they have been
						discriminated against on any of the protected grounds. In Sam’s reply, the EOC endeavors to
						resolve the cases, which have been considered appropriate after examines all information
						relevant through conciliation, helping the disputing parties reach a settlement including
						assists with legal advice, legal assistance, and other forms of support.

					</p>

					<p>Sam pointed out that the complaint figures are not categorized into different industries, so
						there are no actual figures for complaints from journalists at this moment. But in this period,
						when covering the protests, it may be a doubt whether journalists are free to send complaints to
						EOC to seek help.
					</p>

					<p>TA journalist who doesn’t want to show her name pointed out the EOC seldom follow-up on any
						investigations it did. It didn’t respond to the gender issues faced by journalists actively
						until it is urged. The gender issues female journalists faced are not started since these
						protests but at an earlier time or maybe common practice.

					</p>

					<p>“If there is mental assistance provided, I would leave the chance to other journalists as I
						didn’t
						suffer from serious trauma after reporting on the protests. I think the more front-line
						journalists
						may need it more,” said Anna Kam, a year 4 student majoring in International Journalism at Hong
						Kong
						Baptist University. She worked as a freelance journalist for four international media agencies.
						There is no specific mental support or counseling provided.

						<p>"From the disparity in gender wage income to the participation of labor within the labor
							market,
							there
							are still no equal job opportunities for both of the genders in nowadays Hong Kong society,"
							said Social
							Studies Professor Choi Susanne Yuk-ping, the CUHK gender experts. "Sexual harassment has
							emerged
							across
							the industries, mostly based on gender bias and power inequality."</p>

						<p>Choi added that, the dilemma faced by journalists might be more complicated because it
							involves
							not only
							sexual harassment within the news agency but in the face of interviewees. It's quite
							challenging
							for a
							journalist to complain or report at the scene because they have limited abuser's information
							if
							there is
							someone molesting.
						</p>

						<p>In fact, Hong Kong has laws on sexual harassment - Sex Discrimination Ordinance and the
							agency
							dealing
							with sexual harassment - Equal Opportunities Commission, but these mechanisms still have
							shortcomings.
						</p>
						<p>“If sexual harassment is civil conflict-related, such as verbal harassment, the only way to
							complain is
							to go to the EOC. The question is, attacks from interviewees are difficult to characterize
							unless they
							can capture the exact perpetrator on the spot. Besides, the current ordinance does not cover
							sexual
							harassment from interviewees necessarily.” said Choi, “the laws do regulate the employer
							that if
							the
							employee is sexually harassed, the employer will also be subject to corresponding criminal
							responsibility. ”</p>

						<p>Choi believes that the social status of Hong Kong journalists is significantly improving
							during
							and after
							this political disturbance, but news agencies can provide more specialized training to
							journalists, at
							least to let them know if they have to deal with the situation. At the same time, the
							corresponding
							intra-company psychological counseling is also very significant.</p>

						<p>"Many news agency actually fail to set special mechanisms to handle such questions because
							the
							ordinance
							does not stipulate that companies must do so."

					<p>"You are not allowed to do that assignment. Not because of your experience, but because
						you are born to be a female.” Such voice is not uncommon to be heard in a newsroom.</p>

					<p>A female journalist, who does not want to disclose her name, tells about how female journalists
						work in her former workplace, a TV news station.
					</p>

					<p>Female journalists are not allowed to interview “dangerous” situations. For example, in typhoon,
						female journalists are not allowed to go out as they look weaker. This practice starts after the
						TV station received complaints about being harsh to female journalists by sending them out under
						extreme weather. Some people may regard this as a kind of protection for females. However, the
						ultimate goal for a journalist is to reveal the truth and disclose the secret to the public.
						Female journalists may also want to have the chance to report on different kinds of news. These
						are not merely safety concern, but a counter-discrimination towards female journalists.
					</p>

					<p>"Gender dominant happens in the newsroom and outside the newsroom," she said. Neglect the fact
						that the staff of the management level is usually male, and gender issues also happen when
						journalists are reporting.
					</p>

					<p>A journalist, usually a female in Hong Kong, go out do reporting work with a cameraman, usually a
						male. They cooperate in deciding how they report on the news. Think about a case, will an
						experienced male cameraman listen to the idea of a young less experienced female journalist?
						This combination is common in reality.
					</p>

					<p>The number of female dominant in the industry, but the power seems not to come together.
					</p>

					<p>Julie Posetti, who is an Australian journalist, studies cyberharassment and discovers the attacks
						against women journalists. It is mainly targeting on physical appearance and sexual orientation.
						She mentioned women reporters were called words like 'slut,' 'bitch,' or 'presstitute.'

					</p>

					<p>According to a research constructed by a non-profit organization in Britain in 2014, female
						journalists and TV news presenters receiving roughly three times as much abuse as their male
						counterparts.
